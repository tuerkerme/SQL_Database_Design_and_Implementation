#Small Business Inventory Database
Project Overview
The Small Business Inventory Database project involved designing and implementing a database system to manage products, suppliers, sales, and inventory levels for a small business. The primary goal was to create a robust and efficient system to track inventory movements, sales transactions, and supplier details.

##Objectives
Design a relational database schema suitable for a small business inventory system.
Implement the database schema with appropriate tables, relationships, and constraints.
Populate the database with sample data to simulate a realistic environment.
Test the database functionality through various SQL queries.

##Database Design
The database consists of four main tables:

Products: Stores details about products, including product ID, name, description, price, inventory level, and additional attributes like category, weight, dimensions, color, and manufacturer.

Suppliers: Contains information about suppliers, including supplier ID, name, contact information, and address.

Sales: Records sales transactions, with each record including a sale ID, date, product sold, quantity, and total sale amount.

Inventory Movements: Tracks changes in inventory, such as restocking from suppliers or decreases due to sales.

##Implementation
The database was implemented using SQL, with the following key steps:

Schema Creation: SQL statements were written and executed to create the tables with their respective columns, primary keys, and foreign key relationships.

Adding Constraints: Constraints were added to ensure data integrity, such as check constraints on product prices and inventory levels.

Data Insertion: Sample data was inserted into each table to simulate a working inventory system. This included adding products, suppliers, sales records, and inventory movements.

Querying and Testing: The database was tested through various SQL queries to ensure proper functionality. This included queries for inserting new records, updating inventory levels, and retrieving sales information.

Challenges and Solutions
Data Integrity: Ensuring data integrity was a challenge, particularly in maintaining accurate inventory levels. This was addressed by implementing constraints and triggers in the database to automatically update inventory levels upon sales or restocking.

Schema Design: Designing a flexible and scalable schema required careful consideration, especially in determining the relationships between tables. The solution involved iterative design and review to ensure that the schema met all business requirements.

Conclusion
The Small Business Inventory Database project successfully delivered a functional and robust database system tailored for a small business environment. The system efficiently manages inventory, sales, and supplier information, providing a solid foundation for business operations and decision-making.

Future Work
User Interface Development: Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the database, making it accessible to non-technical users.

Reporting Features: Implement advanced reporting features to provide insights into sales trends, inventory levels, and supplier performance.

Scalability Improvements: Enhance the database schema and queries for scalability to accommodate future growth of the business.
